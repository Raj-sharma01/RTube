->Debouncing
Debouncing is a programming practice used to ensure that time-consuming tasks do not fire so often, that it stalls the performance of the web page. In other words, it limits the rate at which a function gets invoked.
    /*
    *if there comes another api call
    *in the time interval of 200ms
    * the earlier one will be terminated on the go
    * and then the newer api call will be done 
    */


->Caching
cache stores a response associated with a request and reuses the stored response for subsequent requests.
